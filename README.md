### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where Eleni teaches another young woman in the market her leatherworking skills, exploring female solidarity in a patriarchal economy.
- Draft a monologue from Lysandros's perspective the night after Chapter 1, detailing his fears of failure and his twisted sense of protection.
- Create a 'day in the life' vignette for Nikias the cobbler, showing his own generational struggles and why he chooses to help Eleni.
- Imagine a scene set five years later: Eleni now has her own stall. Who visits her, and what old conflict resurfaces in a new form?

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a 'Scent-Scape' generator for ancient Athenian neighborhoods, mapping olfactory cues (tanneries, bakeries, incense) to social class and conflict.
- Design an interactive economic model of Eleni's household, where player choices in allocating time (craft vs. market duty) affect family tension and financial survival.
